  <div class="row">
    <div id="Accomplishments" class="section">Falcon's math club is a middleschool club. It helps inspire students
      and
      build their confidence in math. It helps prepare middle schoolers for math competitions and shows them
      different
      ways of thinking about math problems. There will be a vetted student (high school or undergrad) to lead and
      teach
      the club at every meeting.
      </br>
      </br>
      Falcon's math club will provide a vetted student, a curriculum and worksheets for students, diagnostic
      tests, and
      assitance with registration and math tournaments. The curriculum has been carefully crafted and the problems
      have
      been thoughtfully selected from the best competition math problems. The students will get one-on-one help
      with any
      problems they find challenging.
      </br>
      </br>
      The two math tournaments that Falcon's Math Club will prepare the sudents for is Mathcounts and the AMC 8.
      Mathcounts is an in-person math competition that is available for students in 6th grade through 8th grade.
      There
      are 30 questions and students have 40 minutes to complete as many as they can. The AMC 8 has 25 questions
      and
      students also have 40 minutes to complete as many as possible. These are great introducotry competitions and
      can
      help prepare students for the AMC 10 and AMC 12 which they can take in high school.
      </br>
      </br>
      Students will be able to learn time management, learn how different ways to approach math problems, gain
      confidence in their math abilities, and connect with students who share their same interests and
      aspirations.
      Falcon's Math Club is available for all students, no matter their skill or grade level.
